# Java Project - *Decision Tree*

## Description:

DecisionTree works to build a decision tree base on training data.  Then, using the testing data is to test the accuracy of the validity by the tree.  The trainng data and testing data as a pair divid to continus values or categorical values.  The Arraylist framework is implemented for storing data from both training and testing files.  The program will find out the most frequently apeared item, which will be saved in a priority queue and then it repeats the progress until all terms store in the queue.  Then, dequeuing terms from most frequent to least frequent creates a tree by limited height and leaves.  Finally, using testing data follows through the tree path to predict results, which compare the real results in testing label file.
